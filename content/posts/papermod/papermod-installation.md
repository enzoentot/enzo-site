Psychologist Howard Gardner suggested that there are eight different types of intelligence. Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences redefines how we understand intelligence, emphasizing diverse cognitive abilities beyond traditional IQ. This article explores Gardner’s theory and how it compares to other theories. It also discusses the characteristics of each of the different types of intelligence. 

What Is Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences?
Gardner’s theory suggests that intelligence isn’t just one general ability. Instead, people possess various types of intelligence, such as linguistic, logical-mathematical, and interpersonal, which reflect different ways of processing information and solving problems.

According to Gardner’s theory, there are eight different types of intelligence: linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic. Each of these intelligences represents a unique way of processing information and solving problems.

While conventional views of human intelligence focus on an individual’s intellectual potential, the theory of multiple intelligences suggests that intelligence is more than just a single general mental ability. First introduced by Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner in his 1983 book Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences, the theory suggests that people may possess different types of intelligence.

In other words, the theory suggests that there is more than one way to be smart.

**Multiple Intelligences vs. General Intelligence**
Intelligence research suggests that people possess a broad mental capacity that controls many cognitive abilities. Most modern intelligence tests are designed to measure this general intelligence and express it as a single number, or IQ score.

Cognitive factors that make up this general intelligence include fluid reasoning, working memory, visual-spatial processing, general knowledge, and quantitative reasoning.
